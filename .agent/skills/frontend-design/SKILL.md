# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Design Thinking

Before coding:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Choose distinctive fonts, avoid Arial/Inter/Roboto. Pair display font with refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Cohesive aesthetic with CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents.
- **Motion**: Staggered reveals, scroll-triggering, surprising hover states.
- **Spatial Composition**: Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements.
- **Backgrounds**: Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies.

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

- Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Cliche color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character
